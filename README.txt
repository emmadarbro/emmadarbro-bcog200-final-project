Final Project for BCOG 200: Emma Darbro
1.) Project Summary: For this project, I plan to do some rendition of a modified dating app that would analyze certain features like location, height, interests of potential matches. This project would then return a compatability score based off of the user's ranking of importance and the deviations of the potential profiles from their own responses. It would likely be optimal to use integer comparison for most of these categeories, to be able to return a ranked similarity score, but some string variables can be stored in pre-set, subjective caterogies so the compatability score can still be returned. The other profiles would also be pre-set and weighted for each user responses to the importance of each profile category.

2.) Functions and Descriptions:
2a.) def store_profile(user): function to allow the profile user to put in their own (interger) scores for age, height, perceived extroversion, perceived attractiveness (everyone is a ten(:!) and for complexity, could be expanded to ask yes or no OR this or that questions to have some other metrics of matching profile choices
2b.) def rank_importance(profile_categories): function would allow the profile user to rank the importance of each given category in the person/people they are being matched with. This will allow for categories to be weighted with multipliers to compute a compatibility score that is output at the end of the function execution.
2c.) def compute_difference(profile_categories, user, profiles, importance_list): function would allow for the differences amongst user input and set profiles to be calculated and multiplied by each of the importance value weights that the user input. A compatibility score would be returned, and the higher the score, the closer the profile is to what the user is looking for; this will require a better math framing method that described above, but you get the point!

3-4.) project will be completed independently 

UPDATES FOR 3/28 PROJECT CHECKIN:
Overview of material provided to users:
Users of this pseudo dating app alogrithm will answer a series of survey question that pertain to themselves and are integer-based. This algorithm of matching will be primarily based on similarities, and the difference between the responses of the user ansd the profiles in the repository will be calculate for each survey question. I will then use a rendition of the Multi-Utility Atrribute Theorum (MUAT) that is often used for decision making for optimal choices, and requires both attributes, attribute score, and importance of attributes. In this project, the attributes will be extracted from the survey question (family closeness, age, distance, height, income), and their importance will be self reported from the user in the second batch of the survey questions. The attribute "score" will be calculated based on difference of values between responses from the user and the profile directory since this algorith matches based off of similarity. In short, the closest profile match would have a score of "0"
